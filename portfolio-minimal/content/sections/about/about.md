I'm Sam, a high school senior who loves robotics, game development, CAD, and 3D printing. Check out my projects below!

I've considered myself a maker since the fourth grade, but my passion for all things electronic has continued to grow in my high school years.
I love teaching myself new tools and methods of making, whether it be a new programming language, CAD software, 3D printer, or anything else!

Right now, I'm focused on my school's <u>FTC Team</u> and a game development project titled <u>Fetch</u>.
