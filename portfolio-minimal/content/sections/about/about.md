I'm Sam, a college freshman who loves electronics, robotics, game development, CAD, and 3D printing. This page serves as a record of my old projects. Check them out below!

I've considered myself a maker since the fourth grade, but my passion for all things electronic has continued to grow in my high school years.
I love teaching myself new tools and methods of making, whether it be a new programming language, CAD software, 3D printer, or anything else!
