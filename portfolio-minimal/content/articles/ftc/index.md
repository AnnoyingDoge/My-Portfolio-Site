## Introduction

This year, we have established a rookie FTC team, PARC Acadia #22070. Much of the effort of this project has been setup and outreach, rather than actual “making.” The goal is to build a program that lasts and includes as many students as possible. I have previously been a design leader for VEX, but I have moved over to being one of the FTC software leads alongside Abby Andam. At the moment, we have completed code for the prototype robot. 

The first full iteration of our robot competed at a scrimmage in early December at Andover High School, achieving multiple wins, a success for our rookie team.

While the hardware team is building out new features (including deadwheel odometry for use by the Roadrunner library), we are beginning work on a website built in Gatsby, as well as training image recognition with TensorFlow for robot V2.0. 

For robot code, we’re using Android Studio and the <u><a>[FTC Robot Controller Library](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController)</a></u>. Check out our <u><a>[robot code repository](https://github.com/FTC-PARC-Acadia/Power-Play)</a></u> as well as our <u><a>[website repository](https://github.com/FTC-PARC-Acadia/PARC-Website)</a></u>. Abby Andam is largely leading the website effort, as I have little JSX experience.
