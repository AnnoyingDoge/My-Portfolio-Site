## Introduction

This year, we have established a rookie FTC team, PARC Acadia #22070. Much of the effort of this project has been setup and outreach, rather than actual “making.” The goal is to build a program that lasts and includes as many students as possible. I have previously been a design leader for VEX, but I have moved over to being one of the FTC software leads alongside Abby Andam. At the moment, we have completed code for the prototype robot. While the hardware team is building out new features, we are beginning work on a website built in Gatsby as well as starting image recognition with TensorFlow. For robot code, we’re using Android Studio and the <u><a>[FTC Robot Controller Library](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController)</a></u>. Check out our <u><a>[robot code repository](https://github.com/FTC-PARC-Acadia/Power-Play)</a></u> as well as our <u><a>[website repository](https://github.com/FTC-PARC-Acadia/PARC-Website)</a></u>. Abby Andam is largely leading the website effort, as I have little JSX experience.
