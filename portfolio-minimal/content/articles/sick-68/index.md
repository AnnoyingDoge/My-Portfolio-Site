## Introduction

This is the side view of a keyboard I 3D printed and hand-wired using Cherry switches and a Teensy 2.0. The design is by Thingiverse user “FedorSosnin,” though I have made some modifications. It was a fun project I did over the weekend during the summer before eleventh grade. Since the entire device is hand-wired, most of this project was soldering. Since the solid-core wire I had on hand was thicker than I had anticipated, the case wouldn’t close after soldering. So, I drew up a spacer in Fusion 360 and 3D printed it, saving me the time of having to rewire the entire keyboard. After completing the project, I struggled to actually use the keyboard, as the flat profile hurt my wrists. I returned to Fusion 360 to design a piece that would add five degrees of tilt to the board, which worked after a few prototypes. The files can be found on my Github or at this link on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4936789. My hope, in uploading them, is that users with the same issue could have a quick and easy solution.
